\begin{abstract}%
In this study we will show a new method of polishing for Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities known as centrifugal barrel polishing (CBP). Using this method, Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coated samples are polished to a surface roughness comparable to a traditional Nb cavity after electropolishing (EP). We also investigate different methods of cleaning the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface after CBP to remove residual abrasive particles. The polished Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface is analyzed using confocal laser microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to image the surface and measure the surface roughness after polishing. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also used for high resolution analysis of the surface after polishing. Finally, we show that centrifugal barrel polishing can improve the performance of a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF cavity.

\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:Introduction}%
Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are an essential component of particle accelerators used in various fields of science and industry, including high-energy physics, material science, and medical isotope production\cite{boulware2019high}. These cavities accelerate charged particles to very high energies and can achieve higher beam power than normal conducting cavities.

The performance of superconducting radio-frequency cavities is determined by the superconducting properties of the surface layer of the cavity. The low-temperature superconductor Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn has a higher superconducting transition temperature (T\textsubscript{c}), 18~K compared to 9~K, and a higher super-heating magnetic field (H\textsubscript{sh}), around 440 mT compared to 250~mT for the more commonly used niobium\cite{liarte2017theoretical, catelani2008temperature, lin2012effect, kubo2020superfluid}. SRF cavities coated with a layer of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn can, therefore, achieve a much higher accelerating field, up to 100~MV/m in theory, and have a lower surface resistance than niobium SRF cavities at higher temperatures allowing for cavity operation at 4~K instead of the standard 2~K operating temperature. These properties make Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF cavities a promising research topic for future accelerators such as high-energy linacs or small-scale industrial accelerators.

Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities are typically manufactured by coating a Nb cavity with a thin film of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn using Sn vapor-diffusion\cite{posen2017nb3sn, pudasaini2019growth, porter2018update}, exposing a niobium cavity to tin vapor at 1,100~°C to create Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn. The reaction forms a 2-3~µm thick Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn film with grains approximately 1~\si{\micro\meter} large. The grains are faceted and the grain boundaries are thermally etched resulting in approximately 100-150~nm of surface roughness. 

Using the Sn vapor-diffusion coating technique, Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities have only been able to reach a maximum accelerating gradient of 24~MV/m\cite{posen2021advances}, a result that was achieved using a thinner Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coating which is smoother than the typical coating. However, this result has not been reproducible and the performance is lower than the theoretical maximum of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities.

Surface roughness is thought to be one of the limiting factors of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF cavity performance. Surface roughness has been shown to be a cause of Q slope and quench in niobium cavities treated with buffered chemical polishing (BCP) due to sharp grain boundary steps.\cite{knobloch1999high, xu2016simulation} Simulations of the magnetic field near a typical Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface show that the magnetic field is increased by up to 60~percent in some areas compared to a smooth surface\cite{porter2016surface, kubo2015magnetic} and could be higher for particularly rough areas. By reducing the field enhancement caused by surface roughness, a corresponding increase in the cavity accelerating gradient can be expected. 

One method to achieve smoother Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surfaces is polishing. Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn polishing has been a topic of study for some time. Chemical methods such as electropolishing (EP)\cite{pudasaini2018studies,pudasaini2017post,hu2019reducing}, buffered chemical polishing (BCP)\cite{pudasaini2017post,hu2019reducing}, and oxy-polishing\cite{pudasaini2017post,pudasaini2018studies} have been studied, but have failed to produce any meaningful improvement in surface roughness. The expected reason for this is that a large amount of material removal is required to produce a substantial smoothing effect when utilizing chemical methods. Electropolishing treatments for Nb typically remove between 5~µm and 10~µm of material to achieve a smooth surface depending on its initial roughness. This amount of material removal is infeasible for Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn films, since their thickness is only 2-3~µm. Additionally, niobium and Sn react differently to the chemicals used, which can lead to different removal rates for each element, thus changing the surface stoichiometry. Even a small change in the stoichiometry away from Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn can cause a decrease in T\textsubscript{c}\cite{sitaraman2021effect}.

To circumvent these issues, we instead use a technique known as centrifugal barrel polishing (CBP), a procedure commonly used for mechanically polishing Nb SRF cavities, and apply it to Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities. First, Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coated samples are polished to determine the effectiveness of the CBP method and to determine the optimum polishing parameters such as tumbling duration and the abrasive material. The results of the sample experiments are used to decide the polishing parameters for a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coated, 1.3~GHz, TESLA geometry SRF cavity. The RF performance of the cavity is tested before and after the CBP treatment. Finally, the cavity is treated with a low temperature Sn coating process to repair the surface and the RF performance is once again tested.

\section{sample study}%
\label{sec:samplestudy}%
Since Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn is a relatively unexplored material, there are no established polishing parameters or abrasive materials to achieve a good surface finish. To allow for rapid iteration and microscopy surface analysis, we first perform polishing experiments on Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples. To evaluate the performance of CBP, the surface roughness of the polished samples is measured using confocal laser microscopy and the surface is analyzed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). The material removal rate is measured using focused ion-beam tomography.

The samples were prepared using the standard Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coating procedure. 1~\si{\centimeter} disks are cut from a 4~\si{\millimeter} sheet of fine-grain, low RRR niobium. 100~\si{\micro\meters} of material are removed using standard electropolishing\cite{saito2003development}, followed by 5~\si{\micrometers} of removal using cold EP.\cite{crawford2017extreme} The samples are coated with the standard FNAL coating procedure.\cite{posen2017nb3sn} This coating resulted in an approximately 3~\si{\micrometer} thick film with a grain size of 500~\si{\nanometer}. The grain size of the Nb substrate had no effect on the film grain size.
%
\subsection{Centrifugal Barrel Polishing}% 
\label{subsec:CentrifugalBarrelPolishing}%
Centrifugal barrel polishing (CBP) is another method used to polish SRF cavities. Developed by KEK and Nomura Plating Co. in 1995\cite{higuchi1996investigation}, CBP utilizes an abrasive material to mechanically smooth the surface. This method has been used to repair surface damage and to attain a very smooth surface in Nb SRF cavities\cite{cooper2012mirror, cooper2011centrifugal}. 

As of yet, only very limited attempts to apply this technique to Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities have been made. The technique uses a custom built tumbling machine that can fit up to 9-cell size 1.3~GHz cavities. When a cavity is mounted in the tumbling machine and filled with abrasive slurry, the rotating motion of the cavity accelerates the polishing media against the cavity surface at up to 59~\si{\meters\per\second\square}. 

The abrasive material determines the removal rate and minimum surface roughness attainable using CBP. Large-grit material is used to remove material quickly and smooth out large defects like pits and scratches while fine-grit material is used to microscopically smooth the surface. Since the roughness of as-coated Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities is on the order of 100-200~nm, our experiments focus on using fine-grit materials. In this experiment, we use a colloidal nano-particle suspension, purchased from Allied High Tech Products Incorporated, as our abrasive material. 50~nm diameter alumina and 40~nm diameter silica nano-particles suspended in water were tested, but we found no discernible difference between the polishing characteristics of the two materials.

Silicon containing ceramics, such as silica, are a major concern for contamination in the tin coating furnace, since they can release a significant amount of silicon at high temperatures into the furnace. Silicon also reacts with Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn to form to form poorly superconducting silicide phases. Alumina, in contrast, is thermally stable at higher temperatures. This is why alumina is typically used to electrically insulate wires such as thermocouples inside the furnace. The presence of alumina in the furnace during coating has shown to introduce a small concentration of interstitial aluminum in the Nb\textsuperscript{3}Sn film, but does not react to form any new phases. For these reasons, the alumina abrassive particles are prefereable to avoid any risk of furnace contamination.

The nano-particle suspension was mixed with a large, soft material to act as a carrier. The purpose of the carrier material is to carry the nano-particles and to apply a force between them and the cavity surface. Two carrier materials were tested, 13~mm diameter wooden balls and 25~mm compressed wool cubes supplied by Congress Tools, Incorporated.

\subsection{Coupon Cavity}%
\label{subsec:couponcavity}%
To test the centrifugal barrel polishing method on Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples in a realistic environment, we use a coupon cavity\cite{higuchi1996investigation}. This cavity has multiple ports where samples are mounted. The samples sit flush with the inside surface of the coupon cavity, as is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:couponcavity}, where they experience identical polishing conditions to a real cavity surface. This allows for sample experiments that are representative of the final cavity polishing process. Using this method we inspect the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface after polishing under a microscope to determine the best polishing parameters.

CBP was applied to samples mounted in the coupon cavity using the tumbling machine at FNAL. A total of four samples where polished for a duration of 2, 4, 6, and 8~\si{\hours} respectively. The machine was run at its maximum speed of 120~\si(\RPM) for the entire duration.

\subsection{Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn Coating Using Sn Vapor-Diffusion}%
\label{subsec:nb3sncoating}%
The Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples used in this study were coated at Fermilab in a high-vacuum furnace. The coatings were created at 1,100~°C with a Sn crucible acting as the Sn source as well as SnCl\textsubscript{2} acting as a nucleating agent. A detailed review of the coating system at Fermilab shows the specific operating details of the coating system\cite{posen2017nb3sn}.

%
\subsection{Surface Analysis of Mechanically Polished Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn Coated Samples}%
\label{subsec:sampleanalysis}%
The Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples were polished for different lengths of time ranging from 2 to 8~hours using the wooden spheres or the felt cubes as the carrier material. A height map of the polished samples is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opticalsurfaceprofiles}. The smoothness of the samples clearly improves as longer polishing is applied.

\label{fig:materialremovalgraph}%
\end{figure}

By comparing the surface optical micrographs after different amounts of polishing shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:opticalsurfaceprofiles}, it is clear that material is preferentially removed from the highest point on the surface, causing the sharp peaks on the surface to be removed quickly while valleys in the surface are left untouched. The phenomenon is also clearly seen in SEM images of the samples shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:semimages} where the peaks on the grains can be seen to become smoother and then flat as more polishing is applied. This is different from EP, which preferentially smooths areas with high curvature including both peaks and valleys. Due to this different smoothing mechanism, surface roughness is minimized when the thickness of material removed is equal to the height difference between the highest and lowest point on the surface, which is around 1~µm. This is confirmed by the sample experiments, after 8~hours of polishing only the deepest valleys of the initial coating remain.

The surface height maps are used to calculate the root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the samples and is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:surfaceroughnessgraph}. After 6~hours of polishing the surface roughness is comparable to the surface roughness of the well performing, thinly coated Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coatings created at FNAL\cite{posen2021advances}. This is verified by SEM micrographs of a thinly coated sample and a polished sample shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:semimages}A and D. After 8~hours of polishing, the surface roughness is comparable to a typical Nb surface after EP. This level of smoothness has never been achieved for Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities until now. At this level of surface roughness, the performance degradation caused by field enhancement due to surface roughness should be greatly reduced.

The thickness of the film is measured after polishing using FIB/SEM cross-section measurements. Our measurements show that only a small amount of material is removed even after 8~hours of polishing. Fig.~\ref{fig:materialremovalgraph} shows the removal rate of different polishing materials. Samples polished using the felt media show an average removal rate of 170~nm/hour whereas the wooden media shows an average of 95~nm/hour removal rate. This measurement corresponds well with measurement performed on Nb cavities by Palczewski, Et. Al.\cite{palczewski2013exploration} The starting thickness of the samples is between 3-3.5~µm. After 8 hours of polishing there is still over 1.5~µm of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn left on the surface. To completely shield the Nb substrate from the RF fields only a few hundred nanometers of material are required, since the London penetration depth of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn is approximately 100~nm\cite{liarte2017theoretical}.

The surface of the polished samples was analyzed using SEM and TEM to look for surface damage or chemical changes on the surface caused by the tumbling or cleaning process. As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:samplesurfacescratches} and Fig.~\ref{fig:samplesurfacedamagelayer}, the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples polished using wooden spheres were damaged resulting in microscopic scratches on the surface and a nanometer-scale damaged layer. The damaged layer is theorized to consist of disordered Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn layer as no atomic layers are visible and attempts to rotate the sample to align the zone axis in this region were unsuccessful. No surface damage was detected on samples polished using the felt cubes. Since the surface damage may negatively affect the cavity performance, the felt cubes are best to use for polishing Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn.

\section{Polishing a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn Cavity Using CBP}%
\label{sec:cavitycbp}%
Given that CBP was able to produce a smooth surface on Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples, the next step is to apply the polishing to a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavity. The cavity used as the substrate for this experiment is a 1.3~GHz niobium elliptical cavity. The cavity is made of 2.8~mm fine grain niobium with a resudual resistivity ratio(RRR) of 300. However, this cavity was treated with nitrogen doping and electropolishing several times before being coated, which could affect the actual thickness and RRR. In preparation for the coating, the cavity was electropolished for 100~\si{\micrometers} using standard EP and an additional 5~\si{\micrometers} of cold EP to achieve a flat surface. The cavity was then coated using the recipe described in \cite{posen2017nb3sn}. 

A Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn-coated cavity was polished using the felt cube polishing media with a 50~nm alumina abrasive particle suspension. The cavity was polished for 4~hours followed by high-pressure water rinsing and ultrasonic cleaning for 30~minutes to remove any residual abrasive material left by the polishing process. These parameters were chosen as a conservative estimate to minimize the possibility of removing the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn film and allow for more material removal in the future while still providing a considerable improvement in surface roughness.

Visual inspection of the cavity shows that the surface roughness was improved by the polishing procedure. The as-coated surface of the cavity has a matte finish, which is common on Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn-coated surfaces, and after the polishing the cavity has a shiny surface finish. This is indicative of the removal of microscopic surface roughness on the surface of the cavity.
%
\subsection{Low Temperature Recoating Procedure}%
\label{subsec:recoating}%
After the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn-coated cavity was polished using CBP, a secondary coating was applied, which we refer to as the recoating procedure. The purpose of this coating is to repair any surface damage caused by CBP or any subsurface defects, such as tin-deficient regions, that may have been exposed.

The recoating procedure was performed at 1,000~°C. This lower temperature was chosen to minimize any thermal etching of the surface, which could increase the surface roughness. No SnCl\textsubscript{2} was used as it is unnecessary to nucleate any Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn grains. One third of the normal amount of Sn was used during the coating, since no additional film growth is needed. The coating was performed at Fermilab using the coating furnace mentioned in Section~\ref{subsec:nb3sncoating}.

%
\subsection{SRF Cavity RF-Performance Testing}%
\label{subsec:vts}%
The RF performance of the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn-coated cavity was tested three times; first, in the as-coated state with no polishing applied; second, after the CBP treatment; lastly, after the recoating procedure. The performance was tested using the vertical test stand (VTS) at FNAL\cite{pischalnikov2014rf}.

%
\subsection{Testing the Polished Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF Cavity}%
\label{subsec:cavityresults}%
The as-coated performance of the cavity was poor compared to most other Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities reaching an accelerating gradient of around 10~MV/m with a Q of 10\textsuperscript{10} at 4.4~K. After the polishing is applied, the cavity exhibits Q-slope (the quality factor decreases with increasing accelerating field), and the maximum gradient was only 5~MV/m.

After the cavity was treated with the recoating treatment, detailed in Section\ref{subsec:recoating}, the Q-slope is ameliorated and the maximum accelerating gradient increases to 15~MV/m. The quality factor of the cavity was also improved over the as-coated state at 2.0~K, but not at 4.4~K. Fig.~\ref{fig:vtstestgraph} shows the performance of the cavity after each step.

The residual resistance of the cavity is calculated from the 2.0~K measurements under the assumption that the BCS resistance is negligible at this temperature. We assume that the additional resistance measured at 4.4~K is entirely BCS resistance. These assumptions may be false if there are multiple Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn phases on the surface.}%
\label{fig:vtstestgraph}%
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}%
\label{sec:Discussion}%
Using mechanical polishing, we are able to produce smooth Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn films with surface roughness less than 20~nm. This level of surface roughness has thus far been impossible to achieve using existing methods.\cite{posen2021advances,pudasaini2018studies,pudasaini2017post,hu2019reducing} We have also shown that this smoothing can be achieved with only a few hundred nanometers of material removal, much less than what would be required for chemical polishing methods.

This study also shows that mechanical polishing can be used to improve the performance of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities when used in conjunction with a recoating procedure. There are several reasons why polishing a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn might lead to performance improvements. The most obvious is the reduction in surface roughness, which reduces the field enhancement factor around sharp edges. This should lead to a reduction in Q-slope and an increase in quench field\cite{knobloch1999high, xu2016simulation} due to a reduction in the volume of normal conducting material interacting with the RF field. However, only one of these effects is experimentally measure, the increase in quench field, while the Q-slope remains unchanged.

Another effect of polishing is a reduction in the film thickness. Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn is a poor thermal conductor compared to Nb, which can lead to a buildup of heat on the cavity surface. Higher surface temperatures lower the superheating critical magnetic field causing a premature quench. This effect is more significant if there is a point source of heat on the surface caused by a defect. By decreasing the film thickness, the thermal properties are improved which could lead to a higher quench field. From our sample experiments we measured a removal of approximately 700~nm after 4~hours of polishing. Assuming a 3~\si{\micrometer} starting thickness and one dimensional heat diffusion through the film, this reduction could lead to a 30\% increase in the maximum heat flux.

The immediate effect of polishing reduces the quality factor and accelerating gradient of the cavity. The cause of this performance degradation is not known, but could be due to subsurface defects exposed to the surface such as tin-depleted regions\cite{lee2018atomic}. In a previous study, we have shown that tin-depleted regions and regions where the film becomes very thin are common in tin vapor-diffusion coated samples\cite{10073616}. Another possible cause for performance degradation is surface damage or contamination caused by the polishing process. Residual abrasive particles can be seen in the SEM images of the polished samples. Cleaning the surface removes most of the contamination, but there may still be some abrasive particles left on the surface, which could cause performance degradation. Surface damage such as cracks or scratches on the film could also degrade performance, although this seems unlikely as no surface damage was detected on the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples polished with felt cubes. It is possible that the oxide that forms on the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface after polishing is unfavorable for performance compared to the oxide that forms in the furnace after the coating process.

After the recoating process was applied, the cavity performance was improved over the unpolished state. We theorize that the re-coating procedure eliminates the performance degradation by repairing any defects exposed to the surface by the polishing step. A short, low-temperature coating is sufficient to diffuse more Sn into any exposed tin-depleted regions, repair small cracks, and return the surface oxide of the film to its as-coated state. However, it is difficult to determine the exact effects of the recoating without performing a thorough cutout analysis on the cavity. Further studies are necessary to determine the cause of the performance degradation after mechanical polishing and the effects of the recoating procedure on the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface.

It is also worth studying the recoating process on its own to determine if there is any effect on unpolished cavities. The extra Sn provided by the recoating could improve the stoichiometry of the surface and eliminate tin-deficient regions. Additionally, the affects of annealing the cavity at 1000~\si{\celsius} could also be causing a performance increase.

Even after polishing and recoating, the accelerating gradient of the mechanically polished cavity is still below that of the current record holding cavity.\cite{posen2021advances} This suggests that there are multiple mechanisms that contribute towards cavity quench with surface roughness being one of them. By using mechanical polishing to eliminate the effects of surface roughness on the cavity performance, we can isolate these other mechanisms. We plan to apply mechanical polishing to Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities with better as-coated performance so that the differences between these cavities can be determined. If the performance improvement shown in this paper can be realized in cavities with better initial performance, we could see a drastic increase in the maximum accelerating gradient.

Utilizing CBP for Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF cavities is still an under-explored process, and the research presented in this paper only shows our initial attempts at optimizing the process. At the moment we have only a single cavity to base our results on, which limits our ability to understand the process. There are many parameters that can be tweaked to potentially improve the cavity performance, and many questions that are left unanswered. Therefore, we must work to polish more cavities and understand the effects of each step of the process on the final performance.

We still do not know the effect residual abrasive particles have on the cavity performance. Since the alumina abrasive is a dielectric it cannot contribute any significant resistive losses, but dielectric losses could be an issue. There are also general cleanliness concerns from having nanoscopic particles inside the cavity, which could result in vacuum leaks or field emission. The combination of ultrasonic cleaning and HPR shown in this study is likely not sufficient to entirely remove residual abrasives. Further research is necessary to find a reliable cleaning method for polished cavities. Chemical cleaning methods such as HF rinsing or very light electropolishing may be promising in this regard.

Another step that must be studied further is the recoating. The temperature, duration, and amount of Sn used are chosen to minimize any surface roughness caused by the recoating due to thermal etching mechanisms and also to prevent the growth of an excessively thick film which could negatively impact the thermal characteristics of the cavity. However, it is unclear how prominent thermal etching is or what other impact these parameters have on the film microstructure. Work still needs to be done to determine the optimum parameters for repairing the damage caused by the polishing while also minimizing any thermal etching and negative side effects. It is also worth investigating the effects of the recoating on unpolished cavities to see if any performance improvements can be made by introducing more Sn at a lower temperature after the initial coating is complete.

The ability to smooth the surface of the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities also opens opportunities to experiment with coatings of different thicknesses which can then be polished to achieve a smoother surface than is currently possible. Having precice control of the coating thickness aswell as the removal rate of the polishing step could allow for much thinner and smoother films with better thermal conduction properties. Future research will include studying Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coatings with different initial thicknesses and analyzing the prevalence of defects in these films.

\section{Conclusion}%
\label{sec:Conclusion}%
The work presented in this paper shows that centrifugal barrel polishing is a promising treatment for Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities. Through a series of sample studies, we were able to develop a mechanical polishing procedure that can produce surface roughness that was previously unobtainable. We have found that it is possible to attain films with a surface roughness of 20~nm or lower. 

Furthermore, we have shown that this surface polishing technique can be used to improve the performance of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coated cavities when it is paired with a recoating step, which consists of a short, low-temperature Sn coating.
