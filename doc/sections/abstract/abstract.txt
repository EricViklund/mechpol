In this study we will show a new method of polishing for Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities known as centrifugal barrel polishing (CBP). Using this method, Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coated samples are polished to a surface roughness comparable to a traditional Nb cavity after electropolishing (EP). We also investigate different methods of cleaning the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface after CBP to remove residual abrasive particles. The polished Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface is analyzed using con-focal laser microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to image the surface and measure the surface roughness after polishing. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is also used for high resolution analysis of the surface after polishing. Finally, we report the performance of a barrel polished Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavity.
