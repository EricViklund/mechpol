To test the centrifugal barrel polishing method on Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples in a realistic environment, we use a coupon cavity. This cavity has multiple ports where samples can be mounted. The samples sit flush with the inside surface of the coupon cavity, as is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:Coupon Cavity}, where they experience identical polishing conditions to a real cavity surface. This allows for sample experiments that are representative of the final cavity polishing process. Using this method we can inspect the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface after polishing under a microscope to determine the best polishing parameters.
