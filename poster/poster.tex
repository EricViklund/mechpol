                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Centrifugal barrel polishing (CBP) is an effective method of polishing Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coated cavities.
                        \item Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn films polished using CBP can acheive less than 20~nm surface roughness with minimal material removal.
                        \item CBP treatment of a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavity leads to a significant increase in the maximum accelerating gradient.
                        \item A secondary recoating procedure is required to achive this increase.
                    \end{itemize}

                    Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are essential components for providing the electric fields required to accelerate charged particles in particle accelerators. SRF cavities coated with a layer of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn can reach up to 100~MV/m of accelerating field in theory. However, in practice surface roughness and other defects limit Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF cavity performance. Centrifugal barrel polishing (CBP) is a proven technique for mechanically polishing Nb SRF cavities to nanometer scale smoothness. To show the evolution of the surface during CBP, we polish Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples using a coupon cavity, which can simulate cavity polishing conditions.

                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item Centrifugal Barrel Polishing (CBP) is a technique used to polish niobium cavities, without using toxic chemicals such as HF.
                                \item CBP uses a custom built tumbling machine that can fit up to 9-cell size cavities, and can accelerate the polishing media against the cavity surface with up to 6g of force.
                                \item An alumina nanoparticle suspension is used as the abrasive material. Felt cubes are added to push the abrasives against the cavity surface.

                    To evaluate the performance of CBP, the surface roughness of the polished samples is measured using confocal laser microscopy and the surface is analyzed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). The material removal rate is measured using focused ion-beam tomography.
                    \begin{itemize}                        
                        \item Material is preferentially removed from the highest point on the surface.
                        \item The material removal rate is measured to be 170~nm per hour.
                        \item After 6~hours of polishing, the surface roughness is comparable to the surface roughness of the well-performing, thinly coated Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coatings created at Fermilab\cite{posen2021advances}.
                        \item After 8~hours of polishing, the surface roughness is comparable to a typical niobium surface after EP.

A conservative polishing time was used to minimize the possibility of removing the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn film, while still providing a considerable improvement in suface smoothness.

                        \item The as-coated performance is poor, with a maximum gradient of around 10~MV/m and Q of 10\textsuperscript{10} at 4.4~K.
                        \item After polishing, the cavity exhibits Q-slope and the maximum gradient is only 5~MV/m.
                        \item A recoating procedure is applied to repair surface damage and subsurface defects at 1,000~°C, using one third of the normal amount of tin and no SnCl\textsubscript{2}.
                        \item After the recoating procedure, the Q-slope is ameliorated, and the maximum accelerating gradient increases to 15~MV/m.
                        \item The quality factor of the cavity is also improved over the as-coated state at 2.0~K, but not at 4.4~K.
