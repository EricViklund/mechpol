The Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples were polished for different lengths of time ranging from 2 to 8 hours using the wooden spheres or the felt cubes. A height map of the polished samples is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:Optical Surface Profiles}. The smoothness of the samples clearly improves as longer polishing is applied. 

By looking at the surface it is clear that material is preferentially removed from the highest point on the surface. This causes the sharp peaks on the surface to be removed quickly while valleys in the surface are left untouched. This is different from chemical polishing methods, which preferentially smooth areas with high curvature including both peaks and valleys. Due to this different smoothing mechanism, a completely smooth surface is attained after material is removed equal to the height difference between the highest and lowest point on the surface, which is around 1 µm. This is confirmed by the sample experiments, after 8 hours of polishing only the deepest valleys of the initial coating remain.

The surface height maps are used to calculate the root mean square (RMS) surface roughness of the samples and is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:Surface Roughness Graph}. After 6 hours of polishing the surface roughness is comparable to the surface roughness of the well performing, thinly coated Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coatings created at FNAL\cite{posen2021advances}. After 8~hours of polishing, the surface roughness is comparable to a typical niobium surface after EP. This level of smoothness has never been achieved for Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities. At this level of surface roughness, the performance degradation caused by field enhancement due to surface roughness should greatly reduced.

The thickness of the film is measured after polishing using FIB/SEM. Our measurements show that only a small amount of material is removed even after 8~hours of polishing. Samples polished using the felt media show an average removal rate of 170~nm/hour whereas the wooden media shows an average of 95~nm/hour removal rate. The starting thickness of the samples is between 3-3.5~µm. After 8 hours of polishing there is still over 1.5~µm of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn left on the surface. To completely shield the niobium substrate from the RF fields only a few hundred nanometers of material are required, since the London penetration depth of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn is \~100~nm\ref{liarte2017theoretical}.

The surface of the polished samples was analyzed using SEM and TEM to look for surface damage or chemical changes on the surface caused by the tumbling or cleaning process.

As seen in Fig.\ref{fig:Surface Scratches} and Fig.\ref{fig:Surface Damage Layer}, the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples polished using wooden spheres were damaged resulting in microscopic scratches on the surface and a damaged layer consisting of a nanometer-scale disordered Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn layer. No surface damage was detected on samples polished using the felt cubes. Since the surface damage may negatively affect the cavity performance, the felt cubes are best to use for polishing Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn.
