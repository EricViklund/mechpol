The Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples and Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavity used in this study were coated at Fermilab in a high-vacuum furnace. The coatings were created at 1,100 Â°C with a Sn crucible acting as the Sn source as well as SnCl\textsubscript{2} acting as a nucleating agent. A detailed review of the coating system at Fermilab relays the specific operating details of the coating system\cite{posen2017nb3sn}.
