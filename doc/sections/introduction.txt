Superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities are an essential component of particle accelerators used in various fields of science and industry, including high-energy physics, material science, and medical applications. These cavities accelerate charged particles to very high energies and can achieve higher accelerating gradients than traditional, normal-conducting cavities.

The performance of superconducting radio-frequency cavities is determined by the superconducting properties of the surface layer of the cavity. The low-temperature superconductor Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn has a higher superconducting transition temperature (T\textsubscript{c}), 18~K compared to 9~K, and a higher super-heating magnetic field (H\textsubscript{sh}), around 440 mT compared to 250~mT for the more commonly used niobium\cite{liarte2017theoretical}. SRF cavities coated with a layer of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn can, therefore, achieve a much higher accelerating field, up to 100~MV/m in theory, and have a lower surface resistance than niobium SRF cavities at higher temperatures allowing for cavity operation at 4~K instead of the standard 2~K operating temperature. These properties make Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF cavities are a promising research topic for future accelerators such as high-energy linacs or small-scale industrial accelerators.

Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities are typically manufactured by coating a Nb cavity with a thin film of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn using tin vapor-diffusion, exposing a niobium cavity to tin vapor at 1,100~°C to create Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn. The reaction forms a 2-3~µm thick Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn film with grains approximately 1~µm large. The grains are faceted, and the grain boundaries are thermally etched, which results in approximately 100-150~nm of surface roughness. 

Using the Sn vapor-diffusion coating technique, Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities have only been able to reach a maximum accelerating gradient of 24~MV/m\cite{posen2021advances}, a result that was achieved using a thinner Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coating which is smoother than the typical coating. However, this result has not been reproducible and is still short of the theoretical maximum accelerating gradient of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities.

Surface roughness is thought to be one of the limiting factors of Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn SRF cavity performance. Simulations of the magnetic field near a typical Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surface show that the magnetic field is increased by up to 60~percent in some areas compared to a smooth surface\cite{porter2016surface} and could be higher for particularly rough areas. By reducing the field enhancement caused by surface roughness, a corresponding increase in the cavity accelerating gradient can be expected. 

One method to achieve smoother Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn surfaces is polishing. Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn polishing has been a topic of study for some time. Chemical methods such as electropolishing (EP)\cite{pudasaini2018studies,pudasaini2017post,hu2019reducing}, buffered chemical polishing (BCP)\cite{pudasaini2017post,hu2019reducing}, and oxy-polishing\cite{pudasaini2017post,pudasaini2018studies} have been studied, but have failed to produce any meaningful improvement in surface roughness. The expected reason for this is that a large amount of material removal is required to produce a substantial smoothing effect when utilizing chemical methods. Electropolishing treatments for niobium typically remove between 5~µm and 10~µm of material to achieve a smooth surface depending on its initial roughness. This amount of material removal is infeasible for Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn films, since their thickness is only 2-3~µm. Additionally, niobium and tin react differently to the chemicals used, which can lead to different removal rates for each element, thus changing the surface stoichiometry. Even a small change in the stoichiometry away from Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn can cause a decrease in T\textsubscript{c}\cite{sitaraman2021effect}.

Centrifugal barrel polishing (CBP) is another method used to polish SRF cavities, which utilizes an abrasive material to mechanically smooth the surface. This method has been used to repair surface damage and to attain a very smooth surface in niobium SRF cavities\cite{cooper2012mirror}. As of yet, only very limited attempts to apply this technique to Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities have been made.

In this paper, we show a procedure for mechanically polishing Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities using CBP. First, Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coated samples are polished to determine the effectiveness of the CBP method and to determine the optimum polishing parameters such as tumbling duration and the abrasive material. The results of the sample experiments are used to decide the polishing parameters for a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn coated, 1.3~GHz, TESLA geometry SRF cavity. The RF performance of the cavity was tested before and after the CBP treatment. Finally, the cavity is treated with a low temperature tin coating process to repair the surface and the RF performance is once again tested.
