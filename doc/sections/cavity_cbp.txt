Given that CBP was able to produce a smooth surface on Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples, the next step is to apply the polishing to a Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavity. A Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn-coated cavity was polished using the felt cube polishing media with a 50~nm alumina abrasive particle suspension, chosen to avoid the risk of silicon contamination in the coating furnace. The cavity was polished for 4~hours followed by high-pressure water rinsing and ultrasonic cleaning for 30~minutes to remove any residual abrasive material left by the polishing process. These parameters were chosen as a conservative estimate to minimize the possibility of removing the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn film and allow for more material removal in the future while still providing a considerable improvement in surface roughness.

Visual inspection of the cavity shows that the surface roughness was improved by the polishing procedure. The as-coated surface of the cavity has a matte finish, which is common on Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn-coated surfaces, and after the polishing the cavity has a shiny surface finish. This is indicative of the removal of microscopic surface roughness on the surface of the cavity.
