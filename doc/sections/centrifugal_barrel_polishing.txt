Centrifugal Barrel Polishing (CBP) is a technique that was developed by Cooper and Cooley\cite{cooper2012mirror} as a method of polishing niobium cavities without using toxic chemicals such as HF. The technique uses a custom built tumbling machine that can fit up to 9-cell size cavities. When a cavity is mounted in the tumbling machine and filled with abrasive slurry, the rotating motion of the cavity accelerates the polishing media against the cavity surface with up to 6 g of force. 

The abrasive material used determines the removal rate and minimum surface roughness attainable using CBP. Large-grit material is used to remove material quickly and smooth out large defects like pits and scratches while fine-grit material is used to microscopically smooth the surface. The removal rate of different abrasive materials has been studied by Palczewski, et. al.\cite{palczewski2013exploration}

Since the roughness of as-coated Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn cavities is on the order of 100-200 nm, our experiments focus on using fine-grit materials. In this experiment, we use a colloidal nano-particle suspension as our abrasive material. 50 nm diameter alumina and 40 nm diameter silica nano-particles suspended in water were tested, but we found no discernible difference between the two materials.

The nano-particle suspension was mixed with a large, soft material to act as a carrier. The purpose of the carrier material is to carry the nano-particles and to apply a force between them and the cavity surface. Two carrier materials were tested, 13 mm diameter wooden balls and 25 mm felt cubes.
