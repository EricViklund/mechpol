Since Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn is a relatively unexplored material, there are no established polishing parameters or abrasive materials to achieve a good surface finish. To allow for rapid iteration and microscopy surface analysis, we first perform polishing experiments on Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn samples. To evaluate the performance of CBP, the surface roughness of the polished samples is measured using con-focal laser microscopy and the surface is analyzed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). The material removal rate is measured using focused ion-beam tomography.
