After the Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn-coated cavity was polished using CBP, a secondary coating was applied, which we refer to as the re-coating procedure. The purpose of this coating is to repair any surface damage caused by CBP or any subsurface defects, such as tin-deficient regions, that may have been exposed.

The re-coating procedure was performed at 1,000 Â°C. This lower temperature was chosen to minimize any thermal etching of the surface, which could increase the surface roughness. No SnCl\textsubscript{2} was used as it is unnecessary to nucleate any Nb\textsubscript{3}Sn grains. One third of the normal amount of tin was used during the coating, since no additional film growth is needed. The coating was performed at Fermilab using the coating furnace mentioned in Section\ref{sec:coating}.
